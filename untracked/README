untracked/README

This directory contains files not tracked by a source code control program,
such as git. (This README file is the exception.)

The files can have one of two origins.

1. Copied by the mm-common-get command.
2. Generated when gtkmm is built.

Files of type 2 exist here only if gtkmm is built with maintainer-mode=false,
or the directory comes from a tarball.
Files of both types exist here only if gtkmm is built with Meson,
or the tarball is created with Meson.

1. Files copied by mm-common-get
--------------------------------
untracked/docs/doc_install.py or doc-install.pl
               doc_postprocess.py or doc-postprocess.pl
               doxygen-extra.css
               tagfile-to-devhelp2.xsl
untracked/build_scripts/check-dllexport-usage.py
                        dist-build-scripts.py

                        doc-reference.py
                        generate-binding.py

mm-common-get may copy more files, but they are not used by gtkmm.
