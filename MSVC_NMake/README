Building gtkmm-3.0 with Visual Studio 2017

* You will need Visual Studio 2017 (MSVC 15.0). Earlier versions of the compiler, including 14.0 and earlier will not work.
* Install the latest Win32 GTK+ Development files from ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/gtk+
* Build libsigc++, glibmm, cairomm, atkmm and pangomm from source.
* Use the Visual Studio command prompt that is appropriate for your build and navigate to this directory.
* Run nmake /f Makefile.vc CFG=[debug|release].  Also pass in PREFIX=<path> to this command line if
  GTK+, libsigc++, glibmm, cairomm, atkmm and pangomm are not in $(srcroot)\..\vs15\$(platform).  You
  may also need to pass in VULKAN_SDK_DIR=<path_to_base_installation_directory_to_the_LunarG_Vulkan_SDK>
  if the GTK+-4.x build that is being used is built with Vulkan support, so that Vulkan's headers and
  libraries can be found.  Pass in DISABLE_DEPRECATED to disable building deprecated gtkmm APIs into the
  final DLL.
* If you have built libsigc++, glibmm, cairomm, atkmm and pangomm on Visual Studio using the Meson build
  system instead   of using NMake, you can pass in `USE_MESON_LIBS=1` to the NMake command line to link to
  these libraries.  Note that mixing dependent -mm libraries built from NMake Makefiles and Meson is not
  recommended nor supported directly, and one is responsible to ensure gtkmm and the dependent -mm libraries
  link to the same DLL
* Build the tests by appending 'test' to the NMake command line in the previous step.
