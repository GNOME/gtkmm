Building gtkmm-3.0 with Visual Studio 2013 or later

* You will need Visual Studio 2013 (MSVC 12.0) or later. Earlier versions of the compiler, including 11.0
  and earlier will not work.
* Install the latest Win32 GTK+ Development files from ftp://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/binaries/win32/gtk+
* Build libsigc++, glibmm, cairomm atkmm and pangomm from source.
* Use the Visual Studio command prompt that is appropriate for your build and navigate to this directory.
* Run nmake /f Makefile.vc CFG=[debug|release].  Also pass in PREFIX=<path> to this command line if
  GTK+, libsigc++, glibmm, cairomm, atkmm and pangomm are not in $(srcroot)\..\vs[12|14|15]\$(platform).
  Pass in DISABLE_DEPRECATED to disable building deprecated gtkmm APIs into the final DLL.
  Note that vs12 stands for Visual Studio 2013, vs14 stands for Visual Studio 2015 and vs15 stands for
  Visual Studio 2017.
* Build the tests by appending 'test' to the NMake command line in the previous step.
