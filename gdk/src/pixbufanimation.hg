/** The gdk-pixbuf library provides a simple mechanism to load and represent animations.
 * An animation is conceptually a series of frames to be displayed over time.
 * Each frame is the same size. The animation may not be represented as a series of frames internally;
 * for example, it may be stored as a sprite and instructions for moving the sprite around a background.
 * To display an animation you don't need to understand its representation, however; you just ask
 * gdk-pixbuf what should be displayed at a given point in time.
