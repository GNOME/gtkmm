/** Pixel data.
 *
 * %Gdk::Texture is the basic element used to refer to pixel data.
 * It is primarily meant for pixel data that will not change over
 * multiple frames, and will be used for a long time.
 *
 * There are various ways to create %Gdk::Texture objects from a
 * Gdk::Pixbuf, or a %Cairo surface, or other pixel data.
 *
 * The ownership of the pixel data is transferred to the %Gdk::Texture
 * instance; you can only make a copy of it, via download().
 *
 * %Gdk::Texture is an immutable object: That means you cannot change
 * anything about it.
