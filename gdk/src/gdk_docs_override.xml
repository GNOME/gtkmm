<description>
Gets the current pixbuf which should be displayed.

The pixbuf might not be the same size as the animation itself
(Gdk::Pixbuf::get_width(), Gdk::Pixbuf::get_height()).

This pixbuf should be displayed for get_delay_time() milliseconds.

The returned pixbuf will become invalid when the iterator advances
to the next frame, which may happen anytime you call
gdk_pixbuf_animation_iter_advance(). Copy the pixbuf to keep it, with 
Gdk::Pixbuf::copy() as it may get recycled as you advance the iterator.

Only the 10 lower bits are used. The remaining ones must be set to 0 by the
producer.

The first plane usually contains the luma channel. It is mapped
into the 2nd channel.

The second plane usually contains the first chroma chanel.
Subsampled in both the X and Y direction. It is mapped into the
3rd channel.

The third plane usually contains the second chroma channel.
Subsampled in both the X and Y direction. It is mapped into the
1st channel.

Commonly known by the fourcc "S010".
