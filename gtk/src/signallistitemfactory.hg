/** A listitem factory providing signals.
 *
 * %Gtk::SignalListItemFactory is a Gtk::ListItemFactory that provides signals
 * that user code can connect to to manage listitems.
 * Signals are emitted for every listitem in the same order:
 *
 *  1. signal_setup() is emitted to set up permanent things
 *  on the listitem. This usually means constructing the widgets used in the
 *  row and adding them to the listitem.
 *
 *  2. signal_bind() is emitted to bind the item passed via
 *  Gtk::ListItem::property_item() to the widgets that have been
 *  created in step 1 or to add item-specific widgets. Signals are
 *  connected to listen to changes - both to changes in the item to
 *  update the widgets or to changes in the widgets to update the
 *  item. After this signal has been called, the listitem may be shown
 *  in a list widget.
 *
 *  3. signal_unbind() is emitted to undo everything done in step 2.
 *  Usually this means disconnecting signal handlers. Once this signal
 *  has been called, the listitem will no longer be used in a list
 *  widget.
 *
 *  4. signal_bind() and signal_unbind() may be emitted multiple times
 *  again to bind the listitem for use with new items. By reusing
 *  listitems, potentially costly setup can be avoided. However, it
 *  means code needs to make sure to properly clean up the listitem in
 *  step 3 so that no information from the previous use leaks into the
 *  next use.
 *
 * 5. signal_teardown() is emitted to allow undoing the effects of
 * signal_setup(). After this signal was emitted on a listitem, the
 * listitem will be destroyed and not be used again.
 *
 * Note that during the signal emissions, changing properties on the
 * Gtk::ListItems passed will not trigger notify signals as the listitem's
 * notifications are frozen. See Glib::ObjectBase::freeze_notify() for details.
 *
 * For tracking changes in other properties in the Gtk::ListItem, the
 * Gtk::ListItem notify signal is recommended. The signal can be connected
 * in the signal_setup() signal and removed again during signal_teardown().
