/** A top-level container widget used to manage offscreen rendering of child widgets.
 * OffscreenWindow is strictly intended to be used for obtaining
 * snapshots of widgets that are not part of a normal widget hierarchy.
 * It differs from Gtk::Widget::get_snapshot() in that the widget you
 * want to get a snapshot of need not be displayed on the user's screen
 * as a part of a widget hierarchy.  However, since OffscreenWindow
 * is a top-level widget you cannot obtain snapshots of a full window
 * with it since you cannot pack a toplevel widget in another toplevel.
 *
 * The idea is to take a widget and manually set the state of it,
 * add it to an OffscreenWindow and then retrieve the snapshot
 * as a Gdk::Pixbuf.
 *
 * OffscreenWindow derives from Window only as an implementation
 * detail.  Applications should not use any API specific to #GtkWindow
 * to operate on this object.  It should be treated as a Bin that
 * has no parent widget.
 *
 * When contained offscreen widgets are redrawn, OffscreenWindow
 * will emit a "damage-event" signal.
