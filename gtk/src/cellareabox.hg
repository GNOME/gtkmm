/** A cell area that renders CellRenderers into a row or a colum, depending on its orientation.
 *
 * This class uses a notion of packing. Packing
 * refers to adding cell renderers with reference to a particular position
 * in a CellAreaBox. There are two reference positions: the
 * start and the end of the box.
 * When the CellAreaBox is oriented in the Gtk::Orientation::VERTICAL
 * orientation, the start is defined as the top of the box and the end is
 * defined as the bottom. In the  Gtk::Orientation::HORIZONTAL orientation
 * start is defined as the left side and the end is defined as the right
 * side.
 *
 * Alignments of CellRenderers rendered in adjacent rows can be
 * configured by configuring the align_child cell property
 * with CellArea::cell_set_property() or by specifying the "align"
 * argument to pack_start() or pack_end().
