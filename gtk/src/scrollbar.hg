/** A Scrollbar.
 *
 * The #Scrollbar widget is a horizontal or vertical scrollbar,
 * depending on the value of the orientation property.
 *
 * The position of the thumb in a scrollbar is controlled by the scroll
 * adjustments. See Gtk::Adjustment for the fields in an adjustment - for
 * Gtk::Scrollbar, the "value" field represents the position of the scrollbar,
 * which must be between the "lower" field and "upper - page_size." The
 * "page_size" field represents the size of the visible scrollable area. The
 * "step_increment" and "page_increment" fields are used when the user asks
 * to step down (using the small stepper arrows) or page down (using for
 * example the PageDown key).
