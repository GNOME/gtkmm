/** A widget with two adjustable panes.
 *
 * Gtk::Paned has two panes, arranged either
 * horizontally or vertically. The division between
 * the two panes is adjustable by the user by dragging
 * a handle.

 * Child widgets are added to the panes of the widget with pack1() and pack2().
 * The division beween the two children is set by default from the size
 * requests of the children, but it can be adjusted by the user.
 *
 * A paned widget draws a separator between the two child widgets and a small
 * handle that the user can drag to adjust the division. It does not draw any
 * relief around the children or around the separator.  (The space
 * in which the separator is called the gutter.) Often, it is useful to
 * put each child inside a Gtk::Frame with the shadow type set to Gtk::SHADOW_IN
 * so that the gutter appears as a ridge. No separator is drawn if one of
 * the children is missing.
 *
 * Each child has two options that can be set - resize and shrink. If resize is
 * true, then when the GtkPaned is resized, that child will expand or shrink
 * along with the paned widget. If shrink is true, then when that child can be
 * made smaller than it's requisition. Setting shrink to false allows the
 * application to set a minimum size. If resize is false for both children,
 * then this is treated as if resize is true for both children.
 *
 * The application can set the position of the slider as if it were set by the
 * user, by calling set_position().
