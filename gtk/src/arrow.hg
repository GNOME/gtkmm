/** Produces an arrow pointing in one of the four cardinal directions.
 *
 * This is intended for use where a directional arrow (in one of the four
 * cardinal directions) is desired. As such, it has very limited
 * functionality and basically only draws itself in a particular direction
 * and with a particular shadow type.
 *
 * Gtk::Arrow will fill any space alloted to it, but since it is inherited
 * from Gtk::Misc, it can be padded and/or aligned, to fill exactly the
 * space the programmer desires.
 *
 * The Arrow widget looks like this:
 * @image html arrow1.png
 *
 * @ingroup Widgets
 * @deprecated You should instead use a Gtk::Image with a
 * suitable icon name, such as “pan-down-symbolic“. When replacing
 * Gtk::Arrow by an image, pay attention to the fact that Gtk::Arrow automatically
 * flips between Gtk::ARROW_LEFT and Gtk::ARROW_RIGHT,
 * depending on the text direction. To get the same effect with an image,
 * use the icon names “pan-start-symbolic“ and “pan-end-symbolic“, which
 * react to the text direction instead of “pan-left-symbolic“ and
 * “pan-right-symbolic“ which don't.
