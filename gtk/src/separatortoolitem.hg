 * A Gtk::SeparatorToolItem is a Gtk::ToolItem that separates groups of other Gtk::ToolItems.
 * Depending on the theme, it will often look like a vertical line on
 * horizontally docked toolbars. If the property "expand" is <tt>true</tt> and the property "draw"
 * is <tt>false</tt>, a Gtk::SeparatorToolItem will act as a "spring" that forces other items to the
 * ends of the toolbar.
