/**  Renders a spin button in a cell.
 *
 * Gtk::CellRendererSpin renders text in a cell like Gtk::CellRendererText,
 * from which it is derived. But while Gtk::CellRendererText offers a simple
 * entry to edit the text, Gtk::CellRendererSpin offers a Gtk::SpinButton widget.
 * Of course, that means that the text must be parseable as a floating point
 * number.
 *
 * The range of the spinbutton is taken from the adjustment property of the
 * cell renderer, which can be set explicitly or mapped to a column in
 * the tree model, like all properties of cell renders. Gtk::CellRendererSpin
 * also has properties for the climb rate and the number of digits to display.
 * Other Gtk::SpinButton properties can be set in a handler for the start-editing
 * signal.
 *
 * @ingroup TreeView
 * @newin{2,12}
 * @deprecated 4.10: List views use widgets to display their contents.
 *   You should use Gtk::SpinButton instead.
