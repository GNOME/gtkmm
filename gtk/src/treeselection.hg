/** Typedefed as Gtk::TreeView::Selection.
 * This is a helper object to manage the selection for a Gtk::TreeView widget.
 *
 * It is automatically created when a new Gtk::TreeView widget is created, and
 * cannot exist independently of this widget.  The primary reason this class
 * exists is for cleanliness of code and API. That is, there is no conceptual
 * reason all these methods could not be methods on the Gtk::TreeView widget
 * instead of a separate class.
 *
 * The Gtk::TreeSelection object can be obtained from a Gtk::TreeView by
 * calling Gtk::TreeView::get_selection().  It can be manipulated to check the
 * selection status of the tree, as well as to select and deselect individual
 * rows.  Selection is done completely view-side. As a result, multiple views
 * of the same model can have completely different selections.  Additionally,
 * you cannot change the selection of a row on the model that is not currently
 * displayed by the view without expanding its parents first.
 *
 * When monitoring the selection of a view, it's important to remember that the
 * "changed" signal is mostly a hint. That is, it may only emit one signal when
 * a range of rows is selected. Additionally, it may on occasion emit a
 * "changed" signal when nothing has happened.
