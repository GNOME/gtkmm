/** Gtk::SizeGroup provides a mechanism for grouping a number of widgets together so they all request the same amount of space.
 * This is typically useful when you want a column of widgets to have the same size, but you can't use a Gtk::Grid widget.
 *
 * In detail, the size requested for each widget in a Gtk::SizeGroup is the maximum of the sizes that would have been
 * requested for each widget in the size group if they were not in the size group. The mode of the size group (see
 * set_mode()) determines whether this applies to the horizontal size, the vertical size, or both sizes.
 *
 * Note that size groups only affect the amount of space requested, not the size that the widgets finally receive. If
 * you want the widgets in a GtkSizeGroup to actually be the same size, you need to pack them in such a way that they
 * get the size they request and not more. For example, if you are packing your widgets into a table, you would not
 * include the Gtk::FILL flag.
 *
 * Widgets can be part of multiple size groups; GTK+ will compute the horizontal size of a widget from the horizontal
 * requisition of all widgets that can be reached from the widget by a chain of size groups of type
 * Gtk::SIZE_GROUP_HORIZONTAL or Gtk::SIZE_GROUP_BOTH, and the vertical size from the vertical requisition of all widgets
 * that can be reached from the widget by a chain of size groups of type Gtk::SIZE_GROUP_VERTICAL or Gtk::SIZE_GROUP_BOTH.
